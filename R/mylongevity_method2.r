#' my longevity method2 function
#' This function loads a file as a data frame of clients.
#' Using the argument 'indexes_of_variables', this function selects the columns of factors
#' Then using the argument 'list_of_variables' this functions selects the columns of interest to be matched
#' with coefficients (i.e log-hazard ratios) estimated in analysis
#' @param data given data frame of clients,
#' @param indexes_of_variables indices for columns of interest
#' @param list_of_variables columns of interest to be matched to coefficients (i.e log-hazard ratios)
#' @param age age of clients
#' @param a intercept from Gompertz baseline hazards
#' @param b slope from Gompertz baseline hazards
#' @param working_directory the working directory for any data that is produced from the functions to be saved in a folder
#' @keywords life_expectancy
#' @export
