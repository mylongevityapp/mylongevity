\arguments{
\item{data}{given data frame of clients}

\item{dist}{distribution either Weibull or Gompertz}

\item{cluster}{The name of the covariate defining the random effect (is equal to NULL for the fixed-effect model);}

\item{formula.shape}{The object defining the fields for covariates influencing the shape.}

\item{formula.scale}{The formula object defining the fields for time-to-failure (or time-of-start and time-to-failure) and for covariates influencing the proportional hazard term;}

\item{age_of_diagnosis}{age of diagnosis for a particular condition}

\item{time_past_from_diagnosis}{time past diagnosis}

\item{working_directory}{the working directory for any data that is produced from the functions to be saved in a folder}

}
\value{
data frame with all the possible combination of life expectancy for a given data frame of clients
}
\description{
This function loads a file as a data frame of clients for parametric survival model
}
\details{
This method fits the Double Cox regression to the provided data and using the hazard ratios from scale and shape parameters it calculates the life expectancies for all combination of given categorical variables
