}
\arguments{
\item{data}{given data frame of clients}

\item{indexes_of_variables}{indices for columns of interest}

\item{age_of_diagnosis}{age of diagnosis for transient ischemic stroke}

\item{time_past_from_diagnosis}{time past from diagnosis in years from the date of transient ischemic stroke}

\value{
data frame with life expectancies for given data frame of clients
}
\description{
This function loads a file as a data frame of clients.
Using the argument 'indexes_of_variables', this function selects the columns of factors
and matches them to outcomes of hazard ratios from transient ischemic stroke
}
\details{
This method matches the attributes of inputted data with results of hazard ratios from transient ischemic stroke study and produces a table with life expectancies..

For mylongevity_double_cox_method4, user has to specify the data and columns using the argument indexes_of_variables in following order: birth_cohort,sex,IMD_Quintile,BMI_category,asthma,COPD,CKD,myocardial_infarction,PVD_PAD,SMOKING,alcohol_cat,atrial_fibrillation,Diabetes_factor,anticoagulant_agents,groupscases,antihypertensive_agents,APL,heart_failure

The definition of columns are:
   - birth_cohort: indicator for year of birth (0 - born in 1908-1920, 1 - born in 1921-1930, 2 - born in  1931-1940, 3 - born in 1941 - 1960)
   - sex: indicator for gender (1 - Female , 2 - Male)
   - IMD_Quintile: deprivation index (1 (least deprived), 2, 3, 4, 5 (most deprived))
   - BMI_category: categorical variable with numeric value for Body Mass Index  categories (0 - Healthy weight (BMI<25), 1 - Overweight (BMI>=25 and BMI<30) and Obese (BMI>=30))
   - asthma: indicator for asthma (0 - absense of asthma, 1 - presence of asthma)
   - COPD: indicator for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0 - absense of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 - presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
   - CKD: indicator for chronic kidney disease (0 - absense of chronic kidney disease , 1 - presence of chronic kidney disease)
   - myocardial_infarction:  indicator for myocardial infarction (0 - absense of myocardial infarction, 1 - presence of myocardial infarction)
   - PVD_PAD: indicator for peripheral vascular disease (0 - absense of peripheral vascular disease, 1 - presence of peripheral vascular disease)
   - SMOKING: indicator of smoking status (0 - non smoker, 1 - current smoker, 2 - former smoker)
   - alcohol_cat: indicator for alcohol intake variable (0 - non drinker, 1 - drinker)
   - atrial_fibrillation: indicator for atrial fibrillation  (0 - absense of atrial fibrillation, 1 - presence of atrial fibrillation)
   - Diabetes_factor: indicator for diabetes (0 - absense of diabetes, 1 - presence of diabetes and treated, 2 - absense of diabetes and untreated)
   - anticoagulant_agents: indicator for anticoagulant agents (0 - no  anticoagulant agents, 1 - yes anticoagulant agents)
   - groupscases: indicator of cases control group (0 - without transient ischemic attack, 1 - with transient ischemic attack)
   - antihypertensive_agents: indicator for antihypertensive agents (0 - no  antihypertensive agents, 1 - yes antihypertensive agents)
   - APL: indicator for antiplatelet therapy (0 - no antiplatelet therapy, 1 - yes antiplatelet therapy)
   - heart_failure: indicator for heart failure (0 - absense of heart failure, 1 - presence of heart failure)
